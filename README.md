# Svaro

> [!WARNING]
> work in progress, [view Roadmap here](https://github.com/dotnize/svaro/issues/1)

Svaro is a modular visual editor for Svelte 5 inspired by [Puck](https://puckeditor.com) for creating no-code editor experiences like page builders. It's like Craft.js, Builder.io, or Elementor, but as a Svelte library to be used in your own apps with your own components.
